In this analyis I use the data of World Development Indicators in order to visualize how climate change has progressed in both the United States and the World at large.


## Green House Gases 

First I compared total green house gases as a percent increase with 1990 being the baseline year. As you can see from the data while the United States has decreased its output of greenhouse emissions from 2004, World aggregate greenhouse emissions continue to increase. It is important to note that since the y-axis is in percentages, the decrease seen in US emissions doesn't translate do decreasing emissions but instead to a decrease in the rate of the production of green house gases. It becomes clearly apparent from the US graph that since 2004 the United States has done much to slow its production of green house gases. As I found no data available from 2012 to 2016, I cannot be sure how this curve has moved in recent years, but I can speculate that we may be reaching pre 1990's emissions. In the world while we still see a significant increase up to 2012, there has been a slowdown in the last two years. The difference between the US and the World is not surprising as the US is a very developed nation.

```{r us_greenhouse, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(us.tidy, aes(Year,Value))+ geom_point() + ggtitle("U.S Green House Emissions") +ylab("(% change from 1990)") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

ggplot(world.tidy, aes(Year,Value))+ geom_point() + ggtitle("World Green House Emissions") + ylab("(% change from 1990)") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

## Energy Trends

In this graphs I compare the US energy trends to those of the World. There is a great jump in the 1980s World graph which simply accounts for the roughly ~20% of energy data that was not available before. In these graphs we see how natural gas has increasingly chipped away at the coal industry in the US. Based on my research, economically speaking, the coal industry is doomed as regulation and decreasing natural gas prices has made the whole market uncompetitive. Oil has very little market in the US economy and while nuclear power has remained at 20%, renewables have increased and will continue to increasing with dropping solar/wind costs. In the world trend we see that coal still has a strong foothold, but with increasingly lower costs in natural gas and oil, I'd expect this portion to continue to go down. Surprisingly renewables  in the world follow the same curve as in the United States, if not more pronounced. I would of expected for the curve to be lagged, but probably due to globalization and the increasing attention on climate change, more countries have adopted the technologies sooner.

ggplot(us.energy.tidy,aes(x=Year,y=Value, fill=Indicator)) + geom_area() + theme(legend.position="bottom")  +ggtitle("US Energy Trends") + ylab("(% of Total)")

ggplot(world.energy.tidy,aes(x=Year,y=Value, fill=Indicator)) + geom_area() +theme(legend.position="bottom") + ggtitle ("World Energy Trends") + ylab("(% of Total)")
